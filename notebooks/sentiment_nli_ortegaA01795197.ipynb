    "In this section, you’ll analyze how sector-level news sentiment compares to market performance for May. You’ll also measure whether sentiment correlates with returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group companies by **sector** using the metadata.\n",
    "2. For each sector:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Compute **monthly average sentiment** (Feb to May).\n",
    "   * (Optional) Count the number of headlines per month.\n",
    "3. Compute **monthly stock returns** from price data and extract **May returns**.\n",
    "4. Build a comparison table with:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * `SECTOR`\n",
    "   * `SENTIMENT` (May sentiment)\n",
    "   * `RETURN` (May return)\n",
    "5. Compute and print the **correlation** between May sentiment and May returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This step helps evaluate whether optimistic news coverage for a sector is associated with better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Once your analysis is complete, consider:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Which sectors *looked* good in the news but didn’t perform?\n",
    "> * Which sectors performed well despite neutral/negative sentiment?\n",
    "> * Would you invest based on sentiment alone? Why or why not?\n",
