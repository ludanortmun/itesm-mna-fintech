    "By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access and Manipulate Financial Data:**\n",
    "   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve historical stock prices for all companies in the S&P 500 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Key Technical Indicators:**\n",
    "   - Calculate 50-day and 200-day moving averages for each stock in the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Trading Signals:**\n",
    "   - Identify Golden Crosses and Death Crosses as described in technical analysis literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Analyze Recent Market Behavior:**\n",
    "   - Isolate and examine stocks that experienced technical signals (crosses) in the last 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualize Price Trends and Volatility:**\n",
    "   - Plot historical price movements along with moving averages, and compute volatility around signal dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Interpret Technical Indicators in Context:**\n",
    "   - Reflect on what Golden and Death Crosses signify and how traders may respond to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate Strategy Viability:**\n",
    "   - Discuss the strengths and limitations of using moving averages as a standalone trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Connect Technical Analysis to Broader Market Intelligence:**\n",
    "   - Explore how sentiment analysis and news (covered in later sections) could complement technical signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Develop Critical Thinking About Signal Reliability:**\n",
    "   - Assess potential risks of false positives and propose improvements or filters to enhance signal accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Engage in Strategic Reflection:**\n",
    "    - Answer analytical questions aimed at understanding the utility, risks, and presentation of the strategy to a professional audience.\n"
